<h1>Rust Snakes and Ladders</h1>
Rust snakes and ladders is the classic game of snakes and ladders programmed in rust using the<br>
[piston_window crate] (https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston_window). It allows users to add their own obstacles or use randomly generated<br>
obstacles, as well as allowing the user to change the size of the board.
